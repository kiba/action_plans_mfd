* [Edit this plan.](https://github.com/kiba/action_plans_mfd/edit/master/chapter101/action_plan.md)

Goals:
===
  * Survive.
  * Cheer up, Inoue-sensei
  * Respond to the "Join Konoha" question.
  * Make a good present for Keiko.

Methods:
===

### Non-Scene Spare Time Hazo (COMPLETELY OPTIONAL)

* Goal: To increase access for Hazo to hivemind's scientific knowledge to better acquire COSMIC POWER.
* Steps:
  * Begin taking notes on the natural world.
  * Ponder ideas about the nature of reality.
  * If possible, conduct experiments.
* Supporting Information:
  * It is not necessary for the QM to write out this scene, and may be skipped or omitted at QM's pleasure.
  * The QM may inform us of Hazo's ideas.
  * Notetaking is a new quirk/habit he took up.
    * Notes should be about the natural world, people he saw, objects, concepts, etc. 
    * No mission-sensitive info should show up on that notes.
    * Only shown in appropriate context(IE, not on infiltration mission or when he's debriefing and so on).
  * Sapre time is most likely near bedtime or at dawn.
  * See [Science](http://markedfordeath.wikia.com/wiki/Science) for potential discoveries Hazo might make.
* Potential Issues
  * Lack of access to EN's knowledgebase.
    * Unfortuantely, this cannot be fixed easily, unless more books are brought.
  * Hazo got misleading or wrong answers to questions.
    * Can be fixed easily enough if QM informs us what he thought.


### **Scene Inoue-sensei**

* Goals:
  * Finish the conversation with Inoue-sensei.
  * Get back to her on Konoha.
* Steps:
  * [Explain to her that it isn't her fault](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/7817981/).
  * Say you'll think about Konoha, but
    * that you need to think about it and
    * will only do so if it's in the **whole** team's best interest.
  * Get back to her on Konoha at a later date.
     * Analyze the "Join Konoha" question. Consider both the Pros and Cons.
     * Will not commit to anything yet. Need actual team discussion.
     * Does not have to happen this update.
* Supporting Information:
  * On Konoha:
    * Consider the political question from all angle.
    * State that the pros are pretty good.
    * Explain the Cons
      * Needs to be in everyone's interest
        * Not interested in disbanding the team, or abandoning Inoue
        * Kagome will be anxious about returning to Konoha so soon.
        * Risky for Kagome and Hazō, being dangerous sealmasters.
          * Leaf will take our threats very seriously, if they weren't before.
          * People make mistakes occasionally; Hazō does frequently.
      * Does making Leaf powerful help our long-term goals?
        * They gain near-undisputed aerial control, which will unbalance things.
        * Leaf might not actually be all nice.
          * Example: That Hyuga brat from team Gai
          * Leaf showed us only what they want us to see.
          * Leaf might have a dark underbelly that we did not get to see.
        * Leaf may consider us too risky to be nice to
          * Could end up dead.
          * Staying in Konoha mitigates this somewhat.
          * May be assasinated by anti-us factions.
        * Won't prevent WW4 from breaking out.
        * Won't guarantee a merciful Leaf.
        * Will make it hard to fix corruption in Leaf, eg. Scorch Squads
      * Yagura will get mad
        * Mist will go to war with Leaf, which we do not want.
        * OOC: Given the war that may or may not come soon, this may be a non-issue.
      * Unexplored Options:
        * Hidden Mountain: Keiko might has a way in as the Pangolin summoner.
        * Bargaining for something else other than citizenship.
        * Leave the EN altogether.
        * Establishing Hidden Heaven
      * Mori and Wakahisa clans will hate Keiko and Noburi.
        * Both of them really do care about their clans. Unlike us; we just care about mummy.
        * We have to run this with them anyway; if they don't accept we aren't doing it anyway.
* Possible Issues:
 * Inoue-sensei might get puzzled about the political analysis.
 * Inoue-sensei might decide to kill us depending on our answer.
   * Unlikely. Also, extremely silly.


### Scene Noburi

* Goal: We want to help Noburi finish his medical training safely.
* Steps:
    * Let Noburi know that Hazo is supportive of his ambitions as a medic-nin and that we want to help him on that path.
    * Don't spend much time on this before the team Leaf discussion in a later update, since we might not go to Hashimoto.
    * Discuss potential issues, and how we might address them.
    * Suggest that we should be cautious.
* Supporting Information:
* Potential Issues
    * Hashimoto might not want to teach Noburi
      * Ask Noburi what things Hashimoto might want (ryo, Macerators...) and offer to help with getting these things.
    * Hashimoto might reject Noburi completely no matter the rewards.
      * Ask for referal to another medic-nin that the team could learn from.
    * Hunter-nin might notice Noburi and/or his barrel.
      * Bring up Noburi disguising his barrel as a travel sack or appropriate covering.
      * Suggest Noburi obfuscate his movement through clever Henge use:
        * Noburi + Inoue go to Hashimoto's.
          * When Noburi leaves, Inoue creates a Water Clone Henge'd as Noburi.
          * Inoue & clone leave.
          * Repeat when Noburi leaves (at a set time?).


### Scene Gift for Keiko

* Goal: give Something on Keiko's Birthday that she will like.
* Steps:
  * Brainstorm gift idea with the team.
  * Build it.
  * Gift it.
* Suppporting Information:
  * Gift Ideas:
    * Drawing.
    * Depictation on a whetstone.
    * Choose one to three scenes from the list, ordered by what Hazo think is best.
      1. Retrieving the Pangolin summoning scroll and becoming the Pangolin summoner.
        * Emphasis on her overcoming obstacles.
        * Depict the scene after she comes back with Pandaa (ask Kagome's help with this).
      2. Beating us all in that game of EN!Risk (include Team Keiten).
      3. An image of us all (Akane included) with her in the middle (this should be in the center).
      4. Terrifying the shit out of the Irie and Hinago patrols.
      5. Taking down Arikada's bodyguards without using chakra.

* Potential Issues:
  * Kagome-sensei might panic/blow up Hazo at the idea of using sealing fragments
  * Keiko might be depressed by gift showing her in less than favorable light.
    * Use CCnJ to show why this is not the case.


### Scene Sealing Projects

* Goal: Do more sealing research
* Steps:
  * Finish the Skywalker project if it isn't already. (including safety protocol, safety engineering, safety testing, etc)
  * Choose the next sealing project and work on that.
* Supporting Information:
  * Have the team/Kagome pick and choose projects
    * Ideally, it should have the maxmium reward while still fast enough to develop before the next mission.
    * It should be within Hazo's skill level.
  * Seal and technology work, listed in order of desirability. Spend time researching or discussing, depending on idea:
    1. Research alarm seals and Banshee seals
    2. The [Zeppelin Project](http://markedfordeath.wikia.com/wiki/Zeppelin).
      * Start with basic hot air balloon.
        * Acquiring heatproof fabric (or equivalent) for balloon.
        * We know shops sell fabrics, but there may be a more convenient source.
        * Safely producing heat.
        * Consider rigid frame variants, or contained ones that require less active heating.
        * Consider safety protocols for final use; should overlap with Skywalker rules.
        * Outline potential seals for fancy variants.
      * Explain using ancedotes and examples such as the jump and sky lanterns.
    3. Ask about the feasibility of Spider Yoyos
      * Preferably timer-based versions of Skywalkers on throwable wires, so you can Spiderman around.
      * Alternatively, put them on long, rigid rods if stability can't be worked out for wires.
    4. Macerator 3.0
      * Shear force to ≥ 35,000 mPa
      * Priority velocity to ≥ 300 m/s
      * Combine with PMYF.
    5. [Poor Man's Shadow Clone Shuriken](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/page-1563#post-7745502)
    6. Bazooka: Longe range AoE weapon
      * Use a modified version of the unidirectional explosive seal to propel projectiles.
      * If flexible material available, 5SB variant is feasible:
        * This is to protect the barrel during firing.
        * A separate flat platform from bazooka itself to allow quick sealing before shooting,
        * Hang flexible frame inside rigid exoskeleton, with an excess square off bottom with the 5SB preplaced
        * Need not be particularly gun-shaped or bazooka shape.
    7. Gun: Smaller cousin, less collateral damage
      * See the Bazooka for detail
    8. Advanced PMYF Macerators with payloads (for smokebombs, flashbangs, pepper spray).
      * Note: We have to research making the Macerator seals with PMYF function.

      
Contingencies
===

* We should already be ready to relocate at any time. 
  * We should know where we are going to escape.
  * We should have enough seal blanks for escape + mission.
* Escape paths:
   * Have traps set up so we can escape to the southwest river or the eastern coast (depending on the situation).
   * More if Kagome-/Inoue-sensei say so.
* Jiraiya calls us in:
   * Figure out what country we're going to, then draft plans
   * Will probably involve water/coastal routes
   * Should be a good stopping point to end an update.
* Pangolin stuff:
   * Be polite and careful. Let Inoue-sensei or Keiko take the leads.
   * Get ready for a mission. See the Jiraiya section.
*  A wild ??? appears:
   * End update if dangerous things start to happen
   * Focus on opsec, for now.
